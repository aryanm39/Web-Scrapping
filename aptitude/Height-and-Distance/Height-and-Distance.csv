"Two ships are sailing in the sea on the two sides of a lighthouse. The angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse is observed from the ships are 30° and 45° respectively. If the lighthouse is 100 m high, the distance between the two ships is:","['173 m', '200 m', '273 m', '300 m']",C,"Let AB be the lighthouse and C and D be the positions of the ships.Then, AB = 100 m,ACB = 30° andADB = 45°.AB= tan 30° =1AC = AB x3= 1003m.AC3AB= tan 45° = 1AD = AB = 100 m.ADCD = (AC + AD)= (1003+ 100) m= 100(3+ 1)= (100 x 2.73) m= 273 m."
The angle of elevation of a ladder leaning against a wall is 60° and the foot of the ladder is 4.6 m away from the wall. The length of the ladder is:,"['2.3 m', '4.6 m', '7.8 m', '9.2 m']",D,"Let AB be the wall and BC be the ladder.Then,ACB = 60° and AC = 4.6 m.AC= cos 60° =1BC2BC= 2 x AC= (2 x 4.6) m= 9.2 m."
An observer 1.6 m tall is 203away from a tower. The angle of elevation from his eye to the top of the tower is 30°. The height of the tower is:,"['21.6 m', '23.2 m', '24.72 m', 'None of these']",A,"Let AB be the observer and CD be the tower.Draw BECD.Then, CE = AB = 1.6 m,BE = AC = 203m.DE= tan 30° =1BE3DE =203m = 20 m.3CD = CE + DE = (1.6 + 20) m = 21.6 m."
"From a point P on a level ground, the angle of elevation of the top tower is 30°. If the tower is 100 m high, the distance of point P from the foot of the tower is:","['149 m', '156 m', '173 m', '200 m']",C,"Let AB be the tower.Then,APB = 30° and AB = 100 m.AB= tan 30° =1AP3AP= (AB x3) m= 1003m= (100 x 1.73) m= 173 m."
"The angle of elevation of the sun, when the length of the shadow of a tree3times the height of the tree, is:","['30°', '45°', '60°', '90°']",A,"Let AB be the tree and AC be its shadow.LetACB =.Then,AC=3cot=3AB= 30°."
