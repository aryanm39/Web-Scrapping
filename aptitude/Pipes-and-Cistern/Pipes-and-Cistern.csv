"Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank from empty to full in 30 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively. When the tank is empty, all the three pipes are opened. A, B and C discharge chemical solutions P,Q and R respectively.

"Three taps A, B and C can fill a tank in 12, 15 and 20 hours respectively. If A is open all the time and B and C are open for one hour each alternately, the tank will be full in:","['6 hours', '62hours3', '7 hours', '71hours2']",C,"(A + B)'s 1 hour's work =1+1=9=3.12156020(A + C)'s  hour's work =1+1=8=2.12206015Part filled in 2 hrs =3+2=17.201560Part filled in 6 hrs =3 x17=17.6020Remaining part =1 -17=3.2020Now, it is the turn of A and B and3part is filled by A and B in 1 hour.20Total time taken to fill the tank = (6 + 1) hrs = 7 hrs."
"Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank in 6 hours. After working at it together for 2 hours, C is closed and A and B can fill the remaining part in 7 hours.

"A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in:","['41hours3', '7 hours', '8 hours', '14 hours']",D,Work done by the leak in 1 hour =1-3=1.2714Leak will empty the tank in 14 hrs.
"Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 37minutes and 45 minutes respectively. Both pipes are opened. The cistern will be filled in just half an hour, if the B is turned off after:","['5 min.', '9 min.', '10 min.', '15 min.']",B,"Let B be turned off afterxminutes.

A tank is filled by three pipes with uniform flow. The first two pipes operating simultaneously fill the tank in the same time during which the tank is filled by the third pipe alone. The second pipe fills the tank 5 hours faster than the first pipe and 4 hours slower than the third pipe. The time required by the first pipe is:,"['6 hours', '10 hours', '15 hours', '30 hours']",C,"Suppose, first pipe alone takesxhours to fill the tank .Then, second and third pipes will take (x-5) and (x- 9) hours respectively to fill the tank.1+1=1x(x- 5)(x- 9)x- 5 +x=1x(x- 5)(x- 9)(2x- 5)(x- 9) =x(x- 5)x2- 18x+ 45 = 0(x- 15)(x- 3) = 0x= 15.    [neglectingx= 3]"
Two pipes can fill a tank in 20 and 24 minutes respectively and a waste pipe can empty 3 gallons per minute. All the three pipes working together can fill the tank in 15 minutes. The capacity of the tank is:,"['60 gallons', '100 gallons', '120 gallons', '180 gallons']",C,Work done by the waste pipe in 1 minute =1-1+1152024=1-1115120= -1.    [-ve sign means emptying]40Volume of1part = 3 gallons.40Volume of whole = (3 x 40) gallons = 120 gallons.
"Two pipes A and B together can fill a cistern in 4 hours. Had they been opened separately, then B would have taken 6 hours more than A to fill the cistern. How much time will be taken by A to fill the cistern separately?","['1 hour', '2 hours', '6 hours', '8 hours']",C,"Let the cistern be filled by pipe A alone inxhours.Then, pipe B will fill it in (x+ 6) hours.1+1=1x(x+ 6)4x+ 6 +x=1x(x+ 6)4x2- 2x- 24 = 0(x-6)(x+ 4) = 0x= 6.     [neglecting the negative value ofx]"
