                                                    The situation described indicates that Dr. Miller's  practice presents some specific challenges, namely that it is a busy environment with a child clientele. There is also some indication that even highly recommended, experienced hygienists might not be cut out for Dr. Miller's office. There is nothing to suggest that Marilyn (choice a) or James (choice c) would be a good fit for Dr.Miller's practice. Kathy (choice d) has experience and she  is also interested in working with children. However, the fact that she hopes  to become a preschool teacher in the not-too-distant future indicates that she might not be the kind of committed, long-term employee that Dr. Miller needs. Lindy (choice b), with her hands-on experience working with children as well as  a degree from a prestigious dental hygiene program, is the most attractive candidate for the position based on the situation described
