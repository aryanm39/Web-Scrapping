"A man purchased a cow for Rs. 3000 and sold it the same day for Rs. 3600, allowing the buyer a credit of 2 years. If the rate of interest be 10% per annum, then the man has a gain of:","['0%', '5%', '7.5%', '10%']",A,C.P. = Rs. 3000.S.P. = Rs.3600 x 100= Rs. 3000.100 + (10 x 2)Gain = 0%.
The true discount on Rs. 2562 due 4 months hence is Rs. 122. The rate percent is:,"['12%', '131%3', '15%', '14%']",C,P.W. = Rs. (2562 - 122) = Rs. 2440.S.I. on Rs. 2440 for 4 months is Rs. 122.Rate =100 x 122%= 15%.2440 x13
"Rs. 20 is the true discount on Rs. 260 due after a certain time. What will be the true discount on the same sum due after half of the former time, the rate of interest being the same?","['Rs. 10', 'Rs. 10.40', 'Rs. 15.20', 'Rs. 13']",B,S.I. on Rs. (260 - 20) for a given time = Rs. 20.S.I. on Rs. 240 for half the time = Rs. 10.T.D. on Rs. 250 = Rs. 10.T.D. on Rs. 260 = Rs.10x 260= Rs. 10.40250
"The interest on Rs. 750 for 2 years is the same as the true discount on Rs. 960 due 2 years hence. If the rate of interest is the same in both cases, it is:","['12%', '14%', '15%', '162%3']",B,"S.I. on Rs. 750 = T.D. on Rs. 960.This means P.W. of Rs. 960 due 2 years hence is Rs. 750.T.D. = Rs. (960 - 750) = Rs. 210.Thus, S.I. on R.s 750 for 2 years is Rs. 210.Rate =100 x 210%= 14%750 x 2"
The simple interest and the true discount on a certain sum for a given time and at a given rate are Rs. 85 and Rs. 80 respectively. The sum is:,"['Rs. 1800', 'Rs. 1450', 'Rs. 1360', 'Rs. 6800']",C,Sum =S.I. x T.D.=85 x 80= Rs. 1360.(S.I.) - (T.D.)(85 - 80)
The present worth of Rs. 1404 due in two equal half-yearly installments at 8% per annum simple interest is:,"['Rs. 1325', 'Rs. 1300', 'Rs. 1350', 'Rs. 1500']",A,Required sum= P.W. of Rs. 702 due 6 months + P.W. of Rs. 702 due 1 year hence= Rs.100 x 702+100 x 702100 + (8 x 1)100 + 8 x= Rs. (675 + 650)= Rs. 1325.
"If the true discount on s sum due 2 years hence at 14% per annum be Rs. 168, the sum due is:","['Rs. 768', 'Rs. 968', 'Rs. 1960', 'Rs. 2400']",A,P.W. =100 x T.D.=100 x 168= 600.R x T14 x 2Sum = (P.W. + T.D.) = Rs. (600 + 168) = Rs. 768.
"A trader owes a merchant Rs. 10,028 due 1 year hence. The trader wants to settle the account after 3 months. If the rate of interest 12% per annum, how much cash should he pay?","['Rs. 9025.20', 'Rs. 9200', 'Rs. 9600', 'Rs. 9560']",B,Required money= P.W. of Rs. 10028 due 9 months hence= Rs.10028 x 100100 +12 x912= Rs. 9200.
"If Rs. 10 be allowed as true discount on a bill of Rs. 110 due at the end of a certain time, then the discount allowed on the same sum due at the end of double the time is:","['Rs. 20', 'Rs. 21.81', 'Rs. 22', 'Rs. 18.33']",D,S.I. on Rs. (110 - 10) for a certain time = Rs. 10.S.I. on Rs. 100 for double the time = Rs. 20.T.D. on Rs. 120 = Rs. (120 - 100) = Rs. 20.T.D. on Rs. 110 = Rs.20x 110= Rs. 18.33120
Goods were bought for Rs. 600 and sold the same for Rs. 688.50 at a credit of 9 months and thus gaining 2% The rate of interest per annum is:,"['162%3', '141%2', '131%3', '15%']",A,"S.P. = 102% of Rs. 600 =102x 600= Rs. 612.100Now, P.W. = Rs. 612 and sum = Rs. 688.50.T.D. = Rs. (688.50 - 612) = Rs. 76.50.Thus, S.I. on Rs. 612 for 9 months is Rs. 76.50.Rate =100 x 76.50%= 16%612 x34"
The true discount on a bill due 9 months hence at 16% per annum is Rs. 189. The amount of the bill is:,"['Rs. 1386', 'Rs. 1764', 'Rs. 1575', 'Rs. 2268']",B,"Let P.W. be Rs.x.Then, S.I. on Rs.xat 16% for 9 months = Rs. 189.xx 16 x9x1= 189 orx= 1575.12100P.W. = Rs. 1575.Sum due = P.W. + T.D. = Rs. (1575 + 189) = Rs. 1764."
"A man buys a watch for Rs. 1950 in cash and sells it for Rs. 2200 at a credit of 1 year. If the rate of interest is 10% per annum, the man:","['gains Rs. 55', 'gains Rs. 50', 'loses Rs. 30', 'gains Rs. 30']",B,S.P.= P.W. of Rs. 2200 due 1 year hence= Rs.2200 x 100100 + (10 x 1)= Rs. 2000.Gain = Rs. (2000 - 1950) = Rs. 50.
The true discount on Rs. 1760 due after a certain time at 12% per annum is Rs. 160. The time after which it is due is:,"['6 months', '8 months', '9 months', '10 months']",D,P.W. = Rs. (1760 -160) = Rs. 1600.S.I. on Rs. 1600 at 12% is Rs. 160.Time =100 x 160=5years =5x 12months = 10 months.1600 x 1266
"The present worth of Rs. 2310 due 2years hence, the rate of interest being 15% per annum, is:","['Rs. 1750', 'Rs. 1680', 'Rs. 1840', 'Rs. 1443.75']",B,P.W. = Rs.100 x 2310= Rs. 1680.100 +15 x52
