"A boat can travel with a speed of 13 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/hr, find the time taken by the boat to go 68 km downstream.","['2 hours', '3 hours', '4 hours', '5 hours']",C,Speed downstream = (13 + 4) km/hr = 17 km/hr.Time taken to travel 68 km downstream =68hrs = 4 hrs.17
A man's speed with the current is 15 km/hr and the speed of the current is 2.5 km/hr. The man's speed against the current is:,"['8.5 km/hr', '9 km/hr', '10 km/hr', '12.5 km/hr']",C,Man's rate in still water = (15 - 2.5) km/hr = 12.5 km/hr.Man's rate against the current = (12.5 - 2.5) km/hr = 10 km/hr.
A boatman goes 2 km against the current of the stream in 1 hour and goes 1 km along the current in 10 minutes. How long will it take to go 5 km in stationary water?,"['40 minutes', '1 hour', '1 hr 15 min', '1 hr 30 min']",C,Rate downstream =1x 60km/hr = 6 km/hr.10Rate upstream = 2 km/hr.Speed in still water =1(6 + 2) km/hr = 4 km/hr.2Required time =5hrs = 11hrs = 1 hr 15 min.44
A man can row three-quarters of a kilometre against the stream in 11minutes and down the stream in 7minutes. The speed (in km/hr) of the man in still water is:,"['2', '3', '4', '5']",D,"We can write three-quarters of a kilometre as 750 metres,and 11minutes as 675 seconds.Rate upstream =750m/sec=10m/sec.6759Rate downstream =750m/sec=5m/sec.4503Rate in still water =110+5m/sec293=25m/sec18=25x18km/hr185= 5 km/hr."
Speed of a boat in standing water is 9 kmph and the speed of the stream is 1.5 kmph. A man rows to a place at a distance of 105 km and comes back to the starting point. The total time taken by him is:,"['16 hours', '18 hours', '20 hours', '24 hours']",D,Speed upstream = 7.5 kmph.Speed downstream = 10.5 kmph.Total time taken =105+105hours = 24 hours.7.510.5
A man takes twice as long to row a distance against the stream as to row the same distance in favour of the stream. The ratio of the speed of the boat (in still water) and the stream is:,"['2 : 1', '3 : 1', '3 : 2', '4 : 3']",B,"Let man's rate upstream bexkmph.Then, his rate downstream = 2xkmph.(Speed in still water) : (Speed of stream) =2x+x:2x-x22=3x:x22= 3 : 1."
A man rows to a place 48 km distant and come back in 14 hours. He finds that he can row 4 km with the stream in the same time as 3 km against the stream. The rate of the stream is:,"['1 km/hr', '1.5 km/hr', '2 km/hr', '2.5 km/hr']",A,"Suppose he move 4 km downstream inxhours. Then,Speed downstream =4km/hr.xSpeed upstream =3km/hr.x48+48= 14 orx=1.(4/x)(3/x)2So, Speed downstream = 8 km/hr, Speed upstream = 6 km/hr.Rate of the stream =1(8 - 6) km/hr = 1 km/hr.2"
"A motorboat, whose speed in 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. The speed of the stream (in km/hr) is:","['4', '5', '6', '10']",B,"Let the speed of the stream bexkm/hr. Then,Speed downstream = (15 +x) km/hr,Speed upstream = (15 -x) km/hr.30+30= 41(15 +x)(15 -x)2900=9225 -x229x2= 225x2= 25x= 5 km/hr.Video Explanation:https://youtu.be/lMFnNB3YQOo"
"In one hour, a boat goes 11 km/hr along the stream and 5 km/hr against the stream. The speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr) is:","['3 km/hr', '5 km/hr', '8 km/hr', '9 km/hr']",C,Speed in still water =1(11 + 5) kmph = 8 kmph.2Video Explanation:https://youtu.be/KQX_mA3tcVA
"A boat running downstream covers a distance of 16 km in 2 hours while for covering the same distance upstream, it takes 4 hours. What is the speed of the boat in still water?","['4 km/hr', '6 km/hr', '8 km/hr', 'Data inadequate']",B,Rate downstream =16kmph = 8 kmph.2Rate upstream =16kmph = 4 kmph.4Speed in still water =1(8 + 4) kmph = 6 kmph.2Video Explanation:https://youtu.be/3D8uAfzz3l0
The speed of a boat in still water in 15 km/hr and the rate of current is 3 km/hr. The distance travelled downstream in 12 minutes is:,"['1.2 km', '1.8 km', '2.4 km', '3.6 km']",D,Speed downstream = (15 + 3) kmph = 18 kmph.Distance travelled =18 x12km = 3.6 km.60Video Explanation:https://youtu.be/IDOwWUeOldQ
"A boat takes 90 minutes less to travel 36 miles downstream than to travel the same distance upstream. If the speed of the boat in still water is 10 mph, the speed of the stream is:","['2 mph', '2.5 mph', '3 mph', '4 mph']",A,"Let the speed of the streamxmph. Then,Speed downstream = (10 +x) mph,Speed upstream = (10 -x) mph.36-36=90(10 -x)(10 +x)6072xx 60 = 90 (100 -x2)x2+ 48x- 100 = 0(x+ 50)(x- 2) = 0x= 2 mph."
"A man can row at 5 kmph in still water. If the velocity of current is 1 kmph and it takes him 1 hour to row to a place and come back, how far is the place?","['2.4 km', '2.5 km', '3 km', '3.6 km']",A,"Speed downstream = (5 + 1) kmph = 6 kmph.Speed upstream = (5 - 1) kmph = 4 kmph.Let the required distance bexkm.Then,x+x= 1642x+ 3x= 125x= 12x= 2.4 km."
