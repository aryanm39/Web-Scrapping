"Father is aged three times more than his son Ronit. After 8 years, he would be two and a half times of Ronit's age. After further 8 years,  how many times would he be of Ronit's age?","['2 times', '21times2', '23times4', '3 times']",A,"Let Ronit's present age bexyears. Then, father's present age =(x+ 3x) years = 4xyears.(4x+ 8) =5(x+ 8)28x+ 16 = 5x+ 403x= 24x= 8.Hence, required ratio =(4x+ 16)=48= 2.(x+ 16)24"
The sum of ages of 5 children born at the intervals of 3 years each is 50 years. What is the age of the youngest child?,"['4 years', '8 years', '10 years', 'None of these']",A,"Let the ages of children bex, (x+ 3), (x+ 6), (x+ 9) and (x+ 12) years.Then,x+ (x+ 3) + (x+ 6) + (x+ 9) + (x+ 12) = 505x= 20x= 4.Age of the youngest child =x= 4 years."
"The present ages of three persons in proportions 4 : 7 : 9. Eight years ago, the sum of their ages was 56. Find their present ages (in years).","['8, 20, 28', '16, 28, 36', '20, 35, 45', 'None of these']",B,"Let their present ages be 4x, 7xand 9xyears respectively.Then, (4x- 8) + (7x- 8) + (9x- 8) = 5620x= 80x= 4.Their present ages are 4x= 16 years, 7x= 28 years and 9x= 36 years respectively."
Ayesha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother four years younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents?,"['2 years', '4 years', '6 years', '8 years']",C,Mother's age when Ayesha's brother was born = 36 years.Father's age when Ayesha's brother was born = (38 + 4) years = 42 years.Required difference = (42 - 36) years = 6 years.
"A person's present age is two-fifth of the age of his mother. After 8 years, he will be one-half of the age of his mother. How old is the mother at present?","['32 years', '36 years', '40 years', '48 years']",C,"Let the mother's present age bexyears.Then, the person's present age =2xyears.52x+ 8=1(x+ 8)522(2x+ 40) = 5(x+ 8)x= 40."
"The age of father 10 years ago was thrice the age of his son. Ten years hence, father's age will be twice that of his son. The ratio of their present ages is:","['5 : 2', '7 : 3', '9 : 2', '13 : 4']",B,"Let the ages of father and son 10 years ago be 3xandxyears respectively.Then, (3x+ 10) + 10 = 2[(x+ 10) + 10]3x+ 20 = 2x+ 40x= 20.Required ratio = (3x+ 10) : (x+ 10) = 70 : 30 = 7 : 3."
"A father said to his son, ""I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth"". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was:","['14 years', '19 years', '33 years', '38 years']",A,"Let the son's present age bexyears. Then, (38 -x) =x2x= 38.x= 19.Son's age 5 years back (19 - 5) = 14 years."
"A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son. The present age of his son is:","['14 years', '18 years', '20 years', '22 years']",D,"Let the son's present age bexyears. Then, man's present age = (x+ 24) years.(x+ 24) + 2 = 2(x+ 2)x+ 26 = 2x+ 4x= 22."
"The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Six years ago, father's age was five times the age of the son. After 6 years, son's age will be:","['12 years', '14 years', '18 years', '20 years']",D,"Let the present ages of son and father bexand (60 -x) years respectively.Then, (60 -x) - 6 = 5(x- 6)54 -x= 5x- 306x= 84x= 14.Son's age after 6 years = (x+ 6) = 20 years.."
"At present, the ratio between the ages of Arun and Deepak is 4 : 3. After 6 years, Arun's age will be 26 years. What is the age of Deepak at present ?","['12 years', '15 years', '19 and half', '21 years']",B,"Let the present ages of Arun and Deepak be 4xyears and 3xyears respectively. Then,4x+ 6 = 264x= 20x= 5.Deepak's age = 3x= 15 years."
