"In a 100 m race, A can give B 10 m and C 28 m. In the same race B can give C:","['18 m', '20 m', '27 m', '9 m']",B,"A : B = 100 : 90.A : C = 100 : 72.B : C =BxA=90x100=90.AC1007272When B runs 90 m, C runs 72 m.When B runs 100 m, C runs72x 100m= 80 m.90B can give C 20 m."
A and B take part in 100 m race. A runs at 5 kmph. A gives B a start of 8 m and still beats him by 8 seconds. The speed of B is:,"['5.15 kmph', '4.14 kmph', '4.25 kmph', '4.4 kmph']",B,A's speed =5 x5m/sec=25m/sec.1818Time taken by A to cover 100 m =100 x18sec= 72 sec.25Time taken by B to cover 92 m = (72 + 8) = 80 sec.B's speed =92x18kmph= 4.14 kmph.805
In a 300 m race A beats B by 22.5 m  or 6 seconds. B's time over the course is:,"['86 sec', '80 sec', '76 sec', 'None of these']",B,B runs45m in 6 sec.2B covers 300 m in6 x2x 300sec= 80 sec.45
"A runs 1times as fast as B. If A gives B a start of 80 m, how far must the winning post be so that A and B might reach it at the same time?","['200 m', '300 m', '270 m', '160 m']",A,"Ratio of the speeds of A and B =5: 1 = 5 : 3.3Thus, in race of 5 m, A gains 2 m over B.2 m are gained by A in a race of 5 m.80 m will be gained by A in race of5x 80m= 200 m.2Winning post is 200 m away from the starting point."
"In a 100 m race, A can beat B by 25 m and B can beat C by 4 m. In the same race, A can beat C by:","['21 m', '26 m', '28 m', '29 m']",C,A : B = 100 : 75B : C = 100 : 96.A : C =AxB=100x100=100= 100 : 72.BC759672A beats C by (100 - 72) m = 28 m.
"In a 500 m race, the ratio of the speeds of two contestants A and B is 3 : 4. A has a start of 140 m. Then, A wins by:","['60 m', '40 m', '20 m', '10 m']",C,"To reach the winning post A will have to cover a distance of (500 - 140)m,i.e.,360 m.While A covers 3 m, B covers 4 m.While A covers 360 m, B covers4x 360m= 480 m.3Thus, when A reaches the winning post, B covers 480 m and therefore remains 20 m behind.A wins by 20 m."
"In a 100 m race, A beats B by 10 m and C by 13 m. In a race of 180 m, B will beat C by:","['5.4 m', '4.5 m', '5 m', '6 m']",D,"A : B = 100 : 90.A : C = 100 : 87.B=BxA=90x100=30.CAC1008729When B runs 30 m, C runs 29 m.When B runs 180 m, C runs29x 180m= 174 m.30B beats C by (180 - 174) m = 6 m."
"At a game of billiards, A can give B 15 points in 60 and A can give C to 20 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 90?","['30 points', '20 points', '10 points', '12 points']",C,A : B = 60 : 45.A : C = 60 : 40.B=BxA=45x60=45=90= 90 : 80.CAC60404080B can give C 10 points in a game of 90.
"In a race of 200 m, A can beat B by 31 m and C by 18 m. In a race of 350 m, C will beat B by:","['22.75 m', '25 m', '19.5 m', '74m7']",B,"A : B = 200 : 169.A : C = 200 : 182.C=CxA=182x200= 182 : 169.BAB200169When C covers 182 m, B covers 169 m.When C covers 350 m, B covers169x 350m= 325 m.182Therefore, C beats B by (350 - 325) m = 25 m."
"In 100 m race, A covers the distance in 36 seconds and B in 45 seconds. In this race A beats B by:","['20 m', '25 m', '22.5 m', '9 m']",A,Distance covered by B in 9 sec. =100x 9m= 20 m.45A beats B by 20 metres.
"In a game of 100 points, A can give B 20 points and C 28 points. Then, B can give C:","['8 points', '10 points', '14 points', '40 points']",B,A : B = 100 : 80.A : C = 100 : 72.B=BxA=80x100=10=100= 100 : 90.CAC10072990B can give C 10 points.
In a 200 metres race A beats B by 35 m or 7 seconds. A's time over the course is:,"['40 sec', '47 sec', '33 sec', 'None of these']",C,B runs 35 m in 7 sec.B covers 200 m in7x 200= 40 sec.35B's time over the course = 40 sec.A's time over the course (40 - 7) sec = 33 sec.
A can run 22.5 m while B runs 25 m. In a kilometre race B beats A by:,"['100 m', '1111m9', '25 m', '50 m']",A,"When B runs 25 m, A runs45m.2When B runs 1000 m, A runs45x1x 1000m= 900 m.225B beats A by 100 m."
