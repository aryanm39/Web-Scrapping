"How many 4-letter words with or without meaning, can be formed out of the letters of the word, 'LOGARITHMS', if repetition of letters is not allowed?","['40', '400', '5040', '2520']",C,"'LOGARITHMS' contains 10 different letters.Required number of words= Number of arrangements of 10 letters, taking 4 at a time.=10P4= (10 x 9 x 8 x 7)= 5040."
In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'MATHEMATICS' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?,"['10080', '4989600', '120960', 'None of these']",C,"In the word 'MATHEMATICS', we treat the vowels AEAI as one letter.Thus, we have MTHMTCS (AEAI).Now, we have to arrange 8 letters, out of which M occurs twice, T occurs twice and the rest are different.Number of ways of arranging these letters =8!= 10080.(2!)(2!)Now, AEAI has 4 letters in which A occurs 2 times and the rest are different.Number of ways of arranging these letters =4!= 12.2!Required number of words = (10080 x 12) = 120960."
"How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9, which are divisible by 5 and none of the digits is repeated?","['5', '10', '15', '20']",D,"Since each desired number is divisible by 5, so we must have 5 at the unit place. So, there is 1 way of doing it.The tens place can now be filled by any of the remaining 5 digits (2, 3, 6, 7, 9). So, there are 5 ways of filling the tens place.The hundreds place can now be filled by any of the remaining 4 digits. So, there are 4 ways of filling it.Required number of numbers = (1 x 5 x 4) = 20."
