"Due to enormous profits involved in smuggling, hundreds of persons have been attracted towards this anti-national activity. Some of them became millionaires overnight. India has a vast coastline both on the Eastern and Western Coast. It has been a heaven for smugglers who have been carrying on their activities with great impunity.

"It is up to our government and planners to devise ways and means for the mobilisation of about ten crore workers whose families total up about forty crore men, women and children. Our agriculture is over-manned. A lesser number of agriculturists would mean more purchasing or spending power to every agriculturist. This will result in the shortage of man-power for many commodities to be produced for which there will be a new demand from a prosperous agrarian class. This shortage will be removed by surplus man-power released from agriculture as suggested above.The passage best supports the statement that:","['employment in production is more fruitful than employment in agriculture.', 'Indian economy is in a poor shape basically due to improper mobilisation of man-power.', 'a shift of labour from agricultural sector to the industrial sector would uplift the living standard.', 'the industrial sector is labour-deficient while the agricultural sector is over-manned in our country.']",B,No answer description is available.Let's discuss.
"Exports and imports, a swelling favourable balance of trade, investments and bank-balances, are not an index or a balance sheet of national prosperity.

The future of women in India is quite bright and let us hope that they will justify their abilities by rising to the occasion.
