The banker's discount on Rs. 1600 at 15% per annum is the same as true discount on Rs. 1680 for the same time and at the same rate. The time is:,"['3 months', '4 months', '6 months', '8 months']",B,"S.I. on Rs. 1600 = T.D. on Rs. 1680.Rs. 1600 is the P.W. of Rs. 1680,i.e.,Rs. 80 is on Rs. 1600 at 15%.Time =100 x 80year=1year = 4 months.1600 x 153"
The present worth of a sum due sometime hence is Rs. 576 and the banker's gain is Rs. 16. The true discount is:,"['Rs. 36', 'Rs. 72', 'Rs. 48', 'Rs. 96']",D,T.D. =P.W. x B.G.=576 x 16= 96.
The true discount on a bill of Rs. 540 is Rs. 90. The banker's discount is:,"['Rs. 60', 'Rs. 108', 'Rs. 110', 'Rs. 112']",B,P.W. = Rs. (540 - 90) = Rs. 450.S.I. on Rs. 450 = Rs. 90.S.I. on Rs. 540 = Rs.90x 540= Rs. 108.450B.D. = Rs. 108.

The banker's gain on a sum due 3 years hence at 12% per annum is Rs. 270. The banker's discount is:,"['Rs. 960', 'Rs. 840', 'Rs. 1020', 'Rs. 760']",C,T.D. =B.G. x 100= Rs.270 x 100= Rs. 750.R x T12 x 3B.D. = Rs.(750 + 270) = Rs. 1020.
The banker's discount of a certain sum of money is Rs. 72 and the true discount on the same sum for the same time is Rs. 60. The sum due is:,"['Rs. 360', 'Rs. 432', 'Rs. 540', 'Rs. 1080']",A,Sum =B.D. x T.D.= Rs.72 x 60= Rs.72 x 60= Rs. 360.B.D. - T.D.72 - 6012
The certain worth of a certain sum due sometime hence is Rs. 1600 and the true discount is Rs. 160. The banker's gain is:,"['Rs. 20', 'Rs. 24', 'Rs. 16', 'Rs. 12']",C,B.G. =(T.D.)2= Rs.160 x 160= Rs. 16.P.W.1600
