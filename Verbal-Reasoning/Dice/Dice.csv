Which symbol will be on the face opposite to the face with symbol * ?,"['@', '$', '8', '+']",C,"The symbols of the adjacent faces to the face with symbol * are @, -, + and $. Hence the required symbol is 8."
Two positions of dice are shown below. How many points will appear on the opposite to the face containing 5 points?,"['3', '1', '2', '4']",D,In these two positions one of the common face having 1 point is in the same position. Therefore according to rule (2). There will be 4 points on the required face.
Here 4 positions of a cube are shown. Which sign will be opposite to '+' ?,"['%', '-', 'x', '$']",C,From position I and III common face with % is in the same position. Hence according to rule (3) opposite is X.
Two positions of a cubical block are shown. When 5 is at the top which number will be at bottom?,"['1', '2', '3', '4']",C,"In these 2 positions one common face with number 3, is in same position. Hence according to rule (3), 1 is opposite to 6 and 4 is opposite to 2. Therefore 5 is opposite to 3."
"From the four positions of a dice given below, find the color which is opposite to yellow ?","['Violet', 'Red', 'Rose', 'Blue']",A,"The colours adjacent to yellow are orange, blue, red and rose. Hence violet will be opposite to yellow."
When the digit 5 is on the bottom then which number will be on its upper surface?,"['1', '3', '4', '6']",A,"According to the rule no. (3), common faces with number 2 are in same positions. Hence when the digit 5 is on the bottom then 1 will on the upper surface."
How many points will be on the face opposite to the face which contains 3 points?,"['2', '4', '5', '6']",C,"The adjacent faces to the face which 3 points have 2, 1, 4 and 6 points. Hence on the face which is opposite to the face which contains 3 points, there will be 5 points."
Observe the dots on the dice (one to six dots) in the following figures. How many dots are contained on the face opposite to the containing four dots?,"['2', '3', '5', '6']",A,"Here one of the two common faces (5) is in the same position, then according to the rule no (2) the remaining face with the 4 dots will be opposite to face with dots 2."
"Two positions of a dice are shown below. When 3 points are at the bottom, how many points will be at the top?","['2', '5', '4', '6']",C,According to the rule (2) when 3 points are at the bottom then 4 points will be at the top.
"From the positions of a cube are shown below, Which letter will be on the face opposite to face with 'A'?","['D', 'B', 'C', 'F']",A,"The letters of the adjacent faces to the face with letter A, are B, F, C and E. Hence D is the letter of the face opposite to the face with letters (A)."
Which digit will appear on the face opposite to the face with number 4?,"['3', '5', '6', '2/3']",A,"Here the common faces with number 3, are in same positions. Hence 6 is opposite to 2 and 5 is opposite to 1. Therefore 4 is opposite to 3."
Two positions of a dice are shown below. Which number will appear on the face opposite to the face with the number 5?,"['2/6', '2', '6', '4']",C,"According to the rule no. (3), common faces with number 3, are in same positions. Hence the number of the opposite face to face with number 5 will be 6."
How many points will be on the face opposite to in face which contains 2 points?,"['1', '5', '4', '6']",D,"In first two positions of dice one common face containing 5 is same. Therefore according to rule no. (3) the face opposite to the face which contains 2 point, will contains 6 points."
Which number is on the face opposite to 6?,"['4', '1', '2', '3']",B,"As the numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 are adjacent to 6. Hence the number on the face opposite to 6 is 1."
Two positions of a dice are shown below. When number '1' is on the top. What number will be at the bottom?,"['3', '5', '2', '6']",B,"According to the rule (2) when 'one' is at the top, then 5 will be at the bottom."
"Two positions of a cube with its surfaces numbered are shown below. When the surface 4 touch the bottom, what surface will be on the top?","['1', '2', '5', '6']",A,"In these 2 positions one common face with number 1 is in the same position. Hence according to the rule number (3), 2 is opposite 6 and 3 is opposite to 5. Therefore opposite to 4 is 1."
"Here two positions of dice are shown. If there are two dots in the bottom, then how many dots will be on the top?","['2', '3', '5', '6']",C,Here the common faces with 4 dots are in same positions.Hence 2 will be opposite to 5.
Two positions of dice are shown below. How many points will be on the top when 2 points are at the bottom?,"['6', '5', '4', '1']",D,"In these 2 positions of a dice, one common face having points 3 is in the same position. Hence according to rule (3), there will be 4 points on the required face."
