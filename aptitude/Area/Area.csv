"The ratio between the length and the breadth of a rectangular park is 3 : 2. If a man cycling along the boundary of the park at the speed of 12 km/hr completes one round in 8 minutes, then the area of the park (in sq. m) is:","['15360', '153600', '30720', '307200']",B,"Perimeter = Distance covered in 8 min. =12000x 8m = 1600 m.60Let length = 3xmetres and breadth = 2xmetres.Then, 2(3x+ 2x) = 1600 orx= 160.Length = 480 m and Breadth = 320 m.Area = (480 x 320) m2= 153600 m2."
An error 2% in excess is made while measuring the side of a square. The percentage of error in the calculated area of the square is:,"['2%', '2.02%', '4%', '4.04%']",D,100 cm is read as 102 cm.A1= (100 x 100) cm2and A2(102 x 102) cm2.(A2- A1) = [(102)2- (100)2]= (102 + 100) x (102 - 100)= 404 cm2.Percentage error =404x 100%= 4.04%100 x 100
"The difference between the length and breadth of a rectangle is 23 m. If its perimeter is 206 m, then its area is:","['1520 m2', '2420 m2', '2480 m2', '2520 m2']",D,"We have: (l-b) = 23 and 2(l+b) = 206 or (l+b) = 103.Solving the two equations, we get:l= 63 andb= 40.Area = (lxb) = (63 x 40) m2= 2520 m2."

If the area of the field is 680 sq. feet, how many feet of fencing will be required?","['34', '40', '68', '88']",D,"We have:l= 20 ft andlb= 680 sq. ft.So,b= 34 ft.Length of fencing = (l+ 2b) = (20 + 68) ft = 88 ft."
"A tank is 25 m long, 12 m wide and 6 m deep. The cost of plastering its walls and bottom at 75 paise per sq. m, is:","['Rs. 456', 'Rs. 458', 'Rs. 558', 'Rs. 568']",C,Area to be plastered= [2(l+b) xh] + (lxb)= {[2(25 + 12) x 6] + (25 x 12)} m2= (444 + 300) m2= 744 m2.Cost of plastering = Rs.744 x75= Rs. 558.100
"The percentage increase in the area of a rectangle, if each of its sides is increased by 20% is:","['40%', '42%', '44%', '46%']",C,Let original length =xmetres and original breadth =ymetres.Original area = (xy) m2.New length =120xm=6xm.1005New breadth =120ym=6ym.1005New Area =6xx6ym2=36xym2.5525The difference between the original area = xy and new-area 36/25 xy is= (36/25)xy - xy= xy(36/25 - 1)= xy(11/25) or (11/25)xyIncrease % =11xyx1x 100%= 44%.25xyVideo Explanation:https://youtu.be/I3jLjLPn1W4
"A rectangular park 60 m long and 40 m wide has two concrete crossroads running in the middle of the park and rest of the park has been used as a lawn. If the area of the lawn is 2109 sq. m, then what is the width of the road?","['2.91 m', '3 m', '5.82 m', 'None of these']",B,"Area of the park = (60 x 40) m2= 2400 m2.Area of the lawn = 2109 m2.Area of the crossroads = (2400 - 2109) m2= 291 m2.Let the width of the road bexmetres. Then,60x+ 40x-x2= 291x2- 100x+ 291 = 0(x- 97)(x- 3) = 0x= 3.Video Explanation:https://youtu.be/R3CtrAKGxkc"
