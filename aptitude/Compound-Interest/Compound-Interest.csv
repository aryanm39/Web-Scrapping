"A bank offers 5% compound interest calculated on half-yearly basis. A customer deposits Rs. 1600 each on 1stJanuary and 1stJuly of a year. At the end of the year, the amount he would have gained by way of interest is:","['Rs. 120', 'Rs. 121', 'Rs. 122', 'Rs. 123']",B,Amount= Rs.1600 x1 +52+ 1600 x1 +52 x 1002 x 100= Rs.1600 x41x41+ 1600 x41404040= Rs.1600 x4141+ 14040= Rs.1600 x 41 x 8140 x 40= Rs. 3321.C.I. = Rs. (3321 - 3200) = Rs. 121
The difference between simple and compound interests compounded annually on a certain sum of money for 2 years at 4% per annum is Re. 1. The sum (in Rs.) is:,"['625', '630', '640', '650']",A,"Let the sum be Rs.x. Then,C.I. =x1 +42-x=676x-x=51x.100625625S.I. =xx 4 x 2=2x.1002551x-2x= 162525x= 625."
Simple interest on a certain sum of money for 3 years at 8% per annum is half the compound interest on Rs. 4000 for 2 years at 10% per annum. The sum placed on simple interest is:,"['Rs. 1550', 'Rs. 1650', 'Rs. 1750', 'Rs. 2000']",C,C.I.= Rs.4000 x1 +102- 4000100= Rs.4000 x11x11- 40001010= Rs. 840.Sum = Rs.420 x 100= Rs. 1750.3 x 8
"If the simple interest on a sum of money for 2 years at 5% per annum is Rs. 50, what is the compound interest on the same at the same rate and for the same time?","['Rs. 51.25', 'Rs. 52', 'Rs. 54.25', 'Rs. 60']",A,Sum = Rs.50 x 100= Rs. 500.2 x 5Amount= Rs.500 x1 +52100= Rs.500 x21x212020= Rs. 551.25C.I. = Rs. (551.25 - 500) = Rs. 51.25
The compound interest on a certain sum for 2 years at 10% per annum is Rs. 525. The simple interest on the same sum for double the time at half the rate percent per annum is:,"['Rs. 400', 'Rs. 500', 'Rs. 600', 'Rs. 800']",B,"Let the sum be Rs. P.Then,P1 +102- P= 525100P112- 1= 52510P =525 x 100= 2500.21Sum = Rs . 2500.So, S.I. = Rs.2500 x 5 x 4= Rs. 500100"
What is the difference between the compound interests on Rs. 5000 for 1years at 4% per annum compounded yearly and half-yearly?,"['Rs. 2.04', 'Rs. 3.06', 'Rs. 4.80', 'Rs. 8.30']",A,C.I. when interestcompounded yearly= Rs.5000 x1 +4x1 +x 4100100= Rs.5000 x26x512550= Rs. 5304.C.I. when interest iscompounded half-yearly= Rs.5000 x1 +23100= Rs.5000 x51x51x51505050= Rs. 5306.04Difference = Rs. (5306.04 - 5304) = Rs. 2.04
"The compound interest on Rs. 30,000 at 7% per annum is Rs. 4347. The period (in years) is:","['2', '212', '3', '4']",A,"Amount = Rs. (30000 + 4347) = Rs. 34347.Let the time benyears.Then, 300001 +7n= 34347100107n=34347=11449=10721003000010000100n= 2 years."
At what rate of compound interest per annum will a sum of Rs. 1200 become Rs. 1348.32 in 2 years?,"['6%', '6.5%', '7%', '7.5%']",A,"Let the rate be R% p.a.Then, 1200 x1 +R2= 1348.321001 +R2=134832=11236100120000100001 +R2=10621001001 +R=106100100R = 6%"
The least number of complete years in which a sum of money put out at 20% compound interest will be more than doubled is:,"['3', '4', '5', '6']",B,"P1 +20n> 2P6n> 2.1005Now,6x6x6x6> 2.5555So,n= 4 years."
Albert invested an amount of Rs. 8000 in a fixed deposit scheme for 2 years at compound interest rate 5 p.c.p.a. How much amount will Albert get on maturity of the fixed deposit?,"['Rs. 8600', 'Rs. 8620', 'Rs. 8820', 'None of these']",C,Amount= Rs.8000 x1 +52100= Rs.8000 x21x212020= Rs. 8820.
The effective annual rate of interest corresponding to a nominal rate of 6% per annum payable half-yearly is:,"['6.06%', '6.07%', '6.08%', '6.09%']",D,Amount of Rs. 100 for 1 yearwhen compounded half-yearly= Rs.100 x1 +32= Rs. 106.09100Effective rate = (106.09 - 100)% = 6.09%
