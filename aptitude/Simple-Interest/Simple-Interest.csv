"An automobile financier claims to be lending money at simple interest, but he includes the interest every six months for calculating the principal. If he is charging an interest of 10%, the effective rate of interest becomes:","['10%', '10.25%', '10.5%', 'None of these']",B,"Let the sum be Rs. 100. Then,S.I. for first 6 months = Rs.100 x 10 x 1= Rs. 5100 x 2S.I. for last 6 months = Rs.105 x 10 x 1= Rs. 5.25100 x 2So, amount at the end of 1 year = Rs. (100 + 5 + 5.25) = Rs. 110.25Effective rate = (110.25 - 100) = 10.25%"
